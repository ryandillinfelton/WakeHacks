	<p>I Designed and deployed this website for a speech therapist private practice in Durham NC. My goal was to keep the site simple and light so it's made with just HTML, CSS, and JS. To keep things organized the CSS is precompiled from SASS, and the currently undeployed blogging side uses Quilljs for rich text markup and some node packages for deciphering</p>

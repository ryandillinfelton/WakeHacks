			<h3>Orofacial Myology</h3>
			<hr>

			<p>Ms. Felton has been trained in Orofacial Myology and is on the certification track for this treatment designed for children and adults.  Orofacial Myology is the study of normal and abnormal patterns of use of the mouth and face and how these can impact dentition, speech, and eating/swallowing.</p>
			<div class="info-transition expanded-info-closed">
				<h4>An Orofacial Myologist can help with</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Tongue thrusting during speech/swallowing</li>
					<li>Digit sucking habits</li>
					<li>Poor jaw stability</li>
					<li>Speech issues</li>
					<li>Tongue & Lip tie</li>
					<li>Orofacial muscle weakness</li>
					<li>Mouth breathing</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
				An evaluation will be completed and daily homework provided.  This treatment helps shorten the child's time in therapy.

			<h3>Talk Tools Oral Placement Therapy</h3>
			<hr>
			<p>Ms. Felton has completed through Level 3 training in Talk Tools Oral Placement Therapy, an oral motor approach that addresses feeding and speech disorders developed by Sara Rosenfeld-Johnson.  The approach utilizes the auditory and visual stimuli while adding the tactile and proprioceptive sensory systems.
			</p>
			<div class="info-transition expanded-info-closed">
				<p>
				It allows the patient not only to hear and see the cues for speech, but to feel them as well.  In addition, this technique is used to build strength in the orofacial muscles to improve speech clarity and to improve feeding.  An OPT evaluation examines your child&#39;s current functional level and sets up a treatment plan that includes daily homework for the patient with the help of his family and a plan for therapy.  If the child is not being followed in this clinic, updated assessments may be completed monthly or quarterly.

			<h3>Buteyko Breathing Technique</h3>
			<hr>

			<p>Ms. Felton is trained in the Buteyko Breathing Technique, which was developed as a drug free way to reverse dysfunctional breathing, such as in asthma or sleep apnea.  Dysfunctional breathing patterns can lead to several chronic health problems and also impact how an individuals teeth and facial structures develop. The Buteyko Breathing Technique has been tested and has been found to be effective and safe.

			<h3>Feeding</h3>
			<hr>

			<p>Feeding disorders can occur for many different reasons but usually begin due to some disruption in the typical feeding development process. Some problems that can interfere with appropriate feeding advancement include reflux, prematurity, sensory problems, anatomic differences, or oral motor challenges. Behavioral problems often develop out of these.
			</p>
			<div class="info-transition expanded-info-closed">
				<p>
				A baby with a short lingual frenulum, otherwise know as tongue tie, may have difficulty with nursing, resulting in prolonged feeding, falling asleep at the breast, difficulty gaining weight and/or significant breast pain for the mother.  It may also make it difficult for the baby to move food around in the mouth, causing gagging or vomiting.  Reflux, oral-motor disorders and sensory processing differences may also lead to problems with feeding and avoidance of many tastes and textures.  A Feeding evaluation will identify the areas the child is struggling with and a plan will be created to address these specific needs.  Ms. Felton uses an approach to feeding disorders that adresses the underlying problems that are impacting the child’s feeding while working with the family on mealtime practices that may be impeding the child’s progress with a goal of making mealtimes a pleasurable experience for the whole family.

			<h3>Language</h3>
			<hr>

			<p>Children with language disorders often struggle academically.  This may be because the child's processing speed is slow, he doesn’t understand or use language structures, or he has a limited vocabulary.
			</p>
			<div class="info-transition expanded-info-closed">
				<p>
				When a child’s processing is slow, it makes it difficult for him to keep up with the lecture and he consequently misses information.  The child may have auditory working memory limitations that make it challenging to take notes or he may simply not understand complex language well. An evaluation can help to identify the specific areas of need for the child with recommendations for therapy to help improve these skills and classroom accommodations to enhance his learning experience.

			<h3>Sucking Habits</h3>
			<hr>

			<p>Thumb, digit, or pacifier sucking is common in infancy and early childhood but is a habit that should be eliminated before a child gets his or her adult teeth.  These sucking patterns can result in changes to the palate and also to the dentition, often leading to an open bite or other malocclusions.
			</p>
			<div class="info-transition expanded-info-closed">
				<p>
				The clinician will meet with the child and determine his or her readiness to engage in the process of eliminating the habit and work with him or her over a ten day period to eliminate it.  This program helps the child to take the lead role in this process, empowering her and giving her a sense of accomplishment.

			<h3>PROMPT</h3>
			<hr>

			<p>Ms. Felton has also been trained in PROMPT (Prompts for Restructuring Oral Muscular Phonetic Targets), a technique that incorporates neuromotor principles, kinesthetic and proprioceptive information, as well as auditory and visual information to provide feedback to the speech system, in order for an individual to produce clear, functional speech.
			</p>
			<div class="info-transition expanded-info-closed">
				<p>
				The PROMPT clinician provides input to all areas of oral motor system by using touch, pressure, specific placements, as well as creating auditory and visual awareness. This helps an individual achieve controlled, functional speech.
